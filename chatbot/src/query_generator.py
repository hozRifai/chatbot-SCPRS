        Make sure to follow up with the format given in the examples here when you want to query the database.

        Important Notes:
        - The date fields (creation_date, purchase_date) are stored as strings in the format "MM/DD/YYYY".
        - When comparing dates, use the $dateFromString operator to convert the date strings to Date objects.
        Example: {{$dateFromString: {{dateString: "01/01/2012", format: "%m/%d/%Y"}}}}
        - Use the $gte and $lte operators for date range comparisons.
        - Aggregate and group data as needed to answer the question accurately.
        - Project only the necessary fields in the final output.
